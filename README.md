# Learning-AI
This is where I will upload all of the intermediate programs I have created to understand AI.

ANN Example 1
There are two predictor weights and a bias weight that need determining. In this example, the aim is to return the weights -28, 1, and 6.7 based on a hard-coded training set.
This code uses negative reinforcement.

ANN Example 2
This example is the same as example 1 but attempts to add positive reinforcement as well. This code does not produce a solution.

ANN Example 3
This is an example of only negative reinforcement being applied to a hard-coded training set with three predictors.

ANN Example 4
This example is the same as example 1 but, instead of using standard negative reinforcement perceptron learning, the Adaline LMSE algorithm is used. Expected results are roughly: -2.1891, 0.2175, and 0.3673.
This example allows for the greek symbol, ro, from the Adaline algorithm as well as the range in which initial weights can be chosen from to be tweaked with before running the algorithm.
