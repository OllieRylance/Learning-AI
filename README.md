# Learning-AI
This is where I will upload all of the intermediate programs I have created to understand AI.

ANN Example 1
There are two predictor weights and a bias weight that need determining. In this example, the aim is to return the weights -28, 1, and 6.7 based on a hard-coded training set.
This code uses negative reinforcement.

ANN Example 2
This example is the same as example 1 but attempts to add positive reinforcement as well. This code does not produce a solution.

ANN Example 3
This is an example of only negative reinforcement being applied to a hard-coded training set with three predictors.
